    # Perform social media searches
    # Example: Search Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.
    # Return any found phone numbers
    return []

    # Example: Search Pipl, Whitepages, Spokeo, etc.
    # Return any found phone numbers
    return []

    # Check data breach databases
    # Example: Search HaveIBeenPwned, DeHashed, etc.
    # Return any found phone numbers
    return []

This script provides a basic structure for the Email2PhoneNumber tool. It uses argparse to accept an email address as input and then performs various OSINT techniques to find associated phone numbers. The search_social_media, search_people_search_engines, and search_data_breaches functions are placeholders where you would implement the actual search logic for each technique. You would need to integrate with the respective APIs or perform web scraping to retrieve phone numbers from those sources

# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
#Pipfile.lock

# UV
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include uv.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.
#uv.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.
#   https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#commit-your-poetrylock-file-to-version-control
#poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
#pdm.lock
#   pdm stores project-wide configurations in .pdm.toml, but it is recommended to not include it
#   in version control.
